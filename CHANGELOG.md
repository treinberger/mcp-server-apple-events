# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Performance: completed reminders no longer fetched by default** — `readAll()` in the reminder repository previously always called the Swift CLI with `--showCompleted true`, fetching the entire reminder history (including all completed reminders) from EventKit before filtering client-side. The Swift CLI is now invoked with the actual `showCompleted` value from the caller (default `false`), so EventKit filtering happens at the source. This prevents unbounded response sizes that accumulate over years of completed reminders.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- **Priority Support**: Set reminder priority levels (high/medium/low/none) via native EventKit API
- **Recurring Reminders**: Support for daily, weekly, monthly, yearly recurrence with flexible rules
- **Location Triggers**: Geofence-based reminders that trigger on arrival or departure
- **Tags/Labels**: Cross-list categorization with `[#tag]` format stored in notes
- **Subtasks/Checklists**: Checklist items with progress tracking stored in notes
- **New Tool**: `reminders_subtasks` for managing checklist items within reminders
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Filter by priority, recurring, location-based, and tags
- **Visual Indicators**: 🔄 (recurring), 📍 (location), 🏷️ (tags), 📋 (subtasks) in output
- Reminder link utilities for note management
- Explicit timezone offset to `buildTimeFormat` prompt helper
- `reminderDateParser` for safe timezone-aware date parsing
